# Project TP

ProjectTP is an activity based on an original model from Rocketseat's Full-Stack course. As a Brazilian living in Hernandarias, I decided to take on this project to practice my skills by recreating the activity, adding my own features, and promoting my current city.

## New Features and Improvements

This update includes several improvements to enhance user experience and code quality:

- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Added animations for a smoother user experience and highlighted the active navigation link for better usability.
- **Improved Code Organization:** Refactored the CSS into a modular structure using custom properties (`_variables.css`), resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. The new file structure is now: `style.css` (for imports), `global.css`, `header.css`, `main.css`, and `media.css`.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensured the website is fully responsive, providing a better viewing experience on various screen sizes.

## AI Assistance

I was assisted by an AI model in developing and refining the code for this project. The AI provided guidance on structuring the CSS, implementing animations, and organizing the code for better maintainability. This collaboration was instrumental in achieving the final result.

## Learnings

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in HTML and CSS, particularly in creating modular and maintainable code. I learned how to use CSS variables effectively and implemented a more robust responsive design. Moving forward, I plan to continue studying and applying these concepts to create even more complex and polished web projects.
