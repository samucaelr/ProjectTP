# Project TP

ProjectTP is an activity in which the original model was made by Rocketseat for their Full-Stack course, being the first activity of level 3, being Brazilian and living in Hernandarias, I decided to redo the activity, to train my skills and be able to send it to friends and family as advertising for the city where I currently live.

## Learnings

I have strengthened my skills and knowledge with HTML and CSS, and I have also realized that I still have a long way to go and I am willing to continue studying this complex world of computing more and more. I intend to improve more and more, and in the future I will redo this website in a more complex and elaborate way so that it is truly pleasing to the eye and with cleaner code.
