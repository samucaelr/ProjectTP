# TP Project

The TP Project is an activity based on an original template from Rocketseat's Full-Stack course. As a Brazilian living in Hernandarias, I decided to take on this project to practice my skills by recreating the activity, adding my own resources, and promoting my current city.

## New Features and Improvements

This update includes several improvements to enhance the user experience and code quality:

- **Improved UI/UX:** Animations added for a more fluid user experience and active navigation link highlighting for better usability.
- **Improved Code Organization:** The CSS has been refactored into a modular structure using custom properties (`_variables.css`), resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. The new file structure is now: `style.css` (for imports), `global.css`, `header.css`, `main.css`, and `media.css`.

- **Responsiveness:** I ensured the website was fully responsive, providing a better viewing experience across different screen sizes.

## AI Assistance

I had the help of an AI model in developing and refining the code for this project. The AI ​​provided guidance on structuring the CSS, implementing animations, and organizing the code for better maintainability. This collaboration was crucial to achieving the final result.

## Learning

This project allowed me to strengthen my HTML and CSS skills, especially in creating modular and maintainable code. I learned how to use CSS variables effectively and implemented a more robust responsive design.

**Debugging a Tricky Problem: Browser Cache**

During development, a persistent issue with my CSS not updating led me to a crucial learning point: browser caching. Even after fixing the code and publishing it to the live site on GitHub Pages, the browser continued to load an outdated version of the stylesheets. The solution was to clear the cache to force the browser to download the latest files. This taught me the importance of being aware of browser caching during development.

With this in mind, I intend to continue studying and applying these concepts to create even more complex and refined web projects, thus developing my programming skills.
